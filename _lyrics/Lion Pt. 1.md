title: Lion Pt. 1  
---  
      
Spiraling into the dust  
Who will lose first  
Will I take you down   
When my head hits the ground  
  
Almost like a game  
From the outside   
Fighting in a cage  
With no price to win  
  
Losing game  
  
It's too early to give up  
So we go on till the pieces   
Are too broken to pick up  
When it becomes too late to listen  
  
Chorus:  
The more it hurts the more we keep the fight  
Does it matter if we're right?  
There's no one else to protect our pride  
So we go on until we're too bruised to fight  
  
Everything is like a game  
From the outside   
Fighting in a cage   
For a high price to pay  
  
In a cage  
  
I say you don't care enough  
Although I know you care too much  
We're not ready to give up  
Would we rather lose each other?  
  
Chorus   
  
Right before we turn to dust  
What will be the cost  
If I take you down   
When my head hits the ground  
  
It's a losing game  
That we must play   
Fighting in a cage  
For some little crumbs  
  
We must play   
   
You say I don't care enough  
When it's all I'm thinking of  
Will you realize my worth  
After I've given my all?  
  
All I have left is someone to fight  
When I give you my love  
You turn it as a weapon   
See it as a weakness  
I should hide  
There's no one else to protect our pride  
So we go on until we're too bruised to fight
