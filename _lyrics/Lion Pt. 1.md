Spiraling into the dust
Who will lose first
Will I take you down
When my head hits the ground

Almost like a game
From the outside
Fighting in a cage
With no price to win

Losing game

It's too early to give up
So we go on till the pieces
Are too broken to pick up
When it becomes too late to listen

Chorus:
The more it hurts the more we keep the fight
Does it matter if we're right?
There's no one else to protect our pride
So we go on until we're too bruised to fight

Everything is like a game
From the outside
Fighting in a cage
For a high price to pay

In a cage

I say you don't care enough
Although I know you care too much
We're not ready to give up
Would we rather lose each other?

Chorus

Right before we turn to dust
What will be the cost
If I take you down
When my head hits the ground

It's a losing game
That we must play
Fighting in a cage
For some little crumbs

We must play

You say I don't care enough
When it's all I'm thinking of
Will you realize my worth
After I've given my all?

All I have left is someone to fight
When I give you my love
You turn it as a weapon
See it as a weakness
I should hide
There's no one else to protect our pride
So we go on until we're too bruised to fight
