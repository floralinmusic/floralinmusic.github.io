title: Gardenia
---
    
Soft embrace  
Petals gliding on my skin  
Like a wave  
Slowly, deeply numbs me into sleep  
  
Lost in gardenia   
To carry me away  
Watch all my worries fading  
  
Chorus:  
Mesmerizing melody  
Anesthetic waves around me  
Wash away the memories  
To drift me to tranquility serenity  
  
Set me free  
  
Chorus  
  
Ease the pain  
Calming wave  
  
Intoxicating gardenia  
I only can surrender  
And become lighter like a feather  
  
Pastel colors  
Soothing petals floating all over me  
  
Chorus  
  
Set me free
