Passing by Swann's Way cafe
Took me back to you
The radio was on
With our favorite song

Could you help me
Mr. Swann?
How long does it take
to be free
from the illusions
of true love?

There's no going back
The colors all faded away
Now I only see red
In search of lost time

My friends tell me to move on
But there's nowhere to go

Pursuing my dearest love
Like you Mr. Swann
Wasting years of my life
Wanting to die
For a living lie
Like you Mr. Swann

There's no going back
Am I as bad as you say?
Did it feel good to betray?
In search of lost time

Like Mr. Swann
The day I won't care anymore
Is the day I'll find the answers
Craving the mystery
Enchanted by your poetry
Waiting for a paper doll
To show me the light
Only to get sucked into the flames

There's no going back
Did it feel good to betray?
A revenge to heal your pain
In search of lost time
