title: Swan

Passing by Swann's Way cafe  
Took me back to you  
The radio was on  
With our favorite song   
  
Could you help me  
Mr. Swann?  
How long does it take   
to be free   
from the illusions   
of true love?  
  
There's no going back  
The colors all faded away  
Now I only see red  
In search of lost time  
  
My friends tell me to move on  
But there's nowhere to go   
  
Pursuing my dearest love  
Like you Mr. Swann  
Wasting years of my life  
Wanting to die  
For a living lie  
Like you Mr. Swann  
  
There's no going back  
Am I as bad as you say?  
Did it feel good to betray?  
In search of lost time  
  
Like Mr. Swann   
The day I won't care anymore  
Is the day I'll find the answers  
Craving the mystery   
Enchanted by your poetry  
Waiting for a paper doll  
To show me the light  
Only to get sucked into the flames  
  
There's no going back  
Did it feel good to betray?  
A revenge to heal your pain  
In search of lost time
