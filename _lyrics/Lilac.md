Memories, I won't get back  
Words you will never take back  
Only lingering, the smell of lilac  
  
Walking  
To a ghost  
Fading  
To the unknown  
  
These days are gone  
All gone  
  
Distance was, the cause and the cure  
Different world, when I close my eyes  
Only lingering, the scent of lilac  
  
Talking  
To a ghost  
Luring me  
To the obscure  
  
It falls apart  
Falls apart  
  
Will we meet again?  
Before we fade away?  
  
We are  
Worlds apart  
I still  
Hear your voice  
  
Like a ghost  
Lilac ghost  
  
I still  
Hear your voice  
Faintly  
Lilac ghost
