Chorus:
Call me and I'll
Run to you
Into the fire
Not afraid to fight
I'll pay the price
To protect you
From what broke me inside

There's no one to else to protect our pride
I'll do what it takes so you can shine

Though I can't rewrite my past
What if I don't want anyone
To see my true self
Will my scars reopen?
You see
I'd rather lose myself than lose you
You see
I'd rather lose myself than lose you

Chorus

Many times I have been burned
Now I know how to keep you warm
So you don't have to hide
Embrace the light
Giving you my love
The strongest weapon
So you see
I'd rather lose myself than lose you

Chorus x2

There's no one to else to protect our pride
I'll do what it takes so you can shine
