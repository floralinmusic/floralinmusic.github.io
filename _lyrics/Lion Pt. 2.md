Chorus:  
Call me and I'll  
Run to you  
Into the fire  
Not afraid to fight  
I'll pay the price  
To protect you  
From what broke me inside  
  
There's no one to else to protect our pride  
I'll do what it takes so you can shine   
  
Though I can't rewrite my past  
What if I don't want anyone   
To see my true self  
Will my scars reopen?  
You see  
I'd rather lose myself than lose you  
You see  
I'd rather lose myself than lose you  
  
Chorus  
  
Many times I have been burned  
Now I know how to keep you warm  
So you don't have to hide  
Embrace the light  
Giving you my love  
The strongest weapon   
So you see  
I'd rather lose myself than lose you  
  
Chorus x2   
  
There's no one to else to protect our pride  
I'll do what it takes so you can shine
