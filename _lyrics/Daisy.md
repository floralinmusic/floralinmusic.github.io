title: Daisy  
---  
  
I used to fear  
The strength of what I'd feel  
Longing for peace  
Chased by shadows  
I've been trying to conceal  
  
Wanting to please  
Tried to kill some parts of me  
A fake harmony  
Surface healing  
The shadows kept hunting  
  
Prechorus:  
Too fragile  
Volatile  
Just like how  
The daisies lie  
Love me or  
Love me not  
We're uneven  
And radiant  
  
Chorus:  
Come with me  
It's alright getting crazy  
Just release  
The joy that sparks from within  
Come with me  
We will watch the daisies  
As they release  
The strength that's hiding  
  
Come with me  
It's alright being happy  
Just release  
The fears you won't ever need  
Come with me  
We will watch the daisies  
As they release  
The joy they hide within  
  
Afraid to sleep  
Of the dark side creeping in  
Unable to see  
Without imperfections  
Nothing is ever complete  
  
Just like a daisy  
Petals growing randomly  
Unpredictable and  
Not sure of what comes  
Still embracing the sun  
  
Prechorus  
Chorus  
Prechorus
