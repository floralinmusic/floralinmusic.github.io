Fighting it all in vain  
Thinking of you again  
  
Almost feels like a dream  
Tryin' to forget it was real  
Those years could not erase  
The final seconds we had   
We had  
  
Promised I'd let you go  
Accept what you'll never know   
  
But it will not fade   
I'm going insane  
Obsessions and pain  
Drive me  
  
Imagination and dreams  
Begin to feel all so real  
I've been trying to forget  
These numbing flashes keep coming back  
Coming back  
  
Paralyzed  
Sometimes I wish that I was someone else  
Should I try again  
  
Cause it will not fade   
I'm going insane  
Obsessions and pain  
Drive me  
  
I will have to find you  
To feel alive once more  
To say goodbye  
Write the ending  
Before you learn too much   
I'll close the final chapter  
The last time I'll feel your touch  
Then I'll meet you in the stars  
In another life  
In another life   
  
I will have to find you  
To close the final chapter  
Will you realize  
That, all this time  
We belonged to one another?  
  
We belong to one another  
  
The last time I'll feel your touch  
Then I'll meet you in the stars  
In another life  
So I came to say goodbye  
  
See you in another life  
See you in another life
