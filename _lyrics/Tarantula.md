When I first opened my eyes
I could feel their joy
That girl is a beautiful gift
They all said that

Before they left one by one
Promised to come back soon
But most never did
Most never did

Happy to play all by myself
Hoping the noise would fade

Wanting to see her smile again
Behind all the tears rolling on her face
Once again

Chorus:
I try to be fun
I try to be nice
But all I can attract is the dark
Girl you're so different
You're creeping me out
It's no use trying to find your place
Trying to find your place

Coming back with quiet steps
Climbing up the stairs
Hoping they won't notice me
Hoping they won't say a thing

They turn whispers into tornadoes
Saying oh how hard they tried
So it would be a miracle
If I did something of my life

Chorus

On good days I'm a nice girl
Invisible wallflower
On bad days I am scary
Creeping in where nobody wants me
