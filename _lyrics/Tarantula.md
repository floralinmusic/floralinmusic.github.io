When I first opened my eyes  
I could feel their joy  
That girl is a beautiful gift  
They all said that  
  
Before they left one by one  
Promised to come back soon  
But most never did  
Most never did  
  
Happy to play all by myself  
Hoping the noise would fade  
  
Wanting to see her smile again  
Behind all the tears rolling on her face  
Once again  
  
Chorus:  
I try to be fun  
I try to be nice  
But all I can attract is the dark  
Girl you're so different  
You're creeping me out  
It's no use trying to find your place  
Trying to find your place  
  
Coming back with quiet steps  
Climbing up the stairs  
Hoping they won't notice me  
Hoping they won't say a thing  
  
They turn whispers into tornadoes  
Saying oh how hard they tried   
So it would be a miracle  
If I did something of my life  
  
Chorus  
  
On good days I'm a nice girl  
Invisible wallflower  
On bad days I am scary  
Creeping in where nobody wants me
