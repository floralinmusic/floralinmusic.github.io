title: Sunflower
---
  
Falling petals all surrounding me  
Colored by the setting sun  
Beauty fading with the wind  
Soon to be all gone  
  
Prechorus:  
Among the sea of autumn leaves,  
Time flew too fast to believe   
I wish I could just press restart  
Is it too late for a new life?  
  
Chorus:  
Shall I I I I I light the fire  
There is nothing else that takes me higher  
Shall I I I I I make that jump to  
Turn my heart to a sunflower flame  
Tell a a a little lie   
Or wake up from the lullaby  
Dreaming all my life  
To turn my heart to a sunflower flame  
  
Lonely dying flowers dance with me   
From power to fragility  
A golden hour in my dream  
Before we all vanish  
  
Prechorus  
  
Chorus  
  
As the sun set casting shadows  
Reflections in the horizon  
Memories where have they gone  
To the sun  
Too close to the sun
