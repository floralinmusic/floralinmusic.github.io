Falling petals all surrounding me
Colored by the setting sun
Beauty fading with the wind
Soon to be all gone

Prechorus:
Among the sea of autumn leaves,
Time flew too fast to believe
I wish I could just press restart
Is it too late for a new life?

Chorus:
Shall I I I I I light the fire
There is nothing else that takes me higher
Shall I I I I I make that jump to
Turn my heart to a sunflower flame
Tell a a a little lie
Or wake up from the lullaby
Dreaming all my life
To turn my heart to a sunflower flame

Lonely dying flowers dance with me
From power to fragility
A golden hour in my dream
Before we all vanish

Prechorus

Chorus

As the sun set casting shadows
Reflections in the horizon
Memories where have they gone
To the sun
Too close to the sun
