Love me for me  
It never works  
Am I an actor  
With the role of my life?  
  
Longing for someone  
Craving for more  
Running from places   
Where nobody cared  
  
So I'll please you like actors do  
Change my colors  
So you like my reflection  
  
Chorus:  
Love me for me never works  
Actors, that's what we learn  
But I'll say I love you for you   
Cause we both wish it was the truth  
If only it could be the truth  
But that's just like what actors do  
  
I'll be your friend   
Someone who listens  
I won't ask the wrong question  
Won't ask you to change  
But if you don't like my colors  
I can adapt   
It's what I've been doing  
For my whole life  
  
You think that you know me  
I've been trained the whole time  
To be there when you ask  
Getting used to the punches  
  
Disappointed with my decisions   
If I don't ask you first   
Disappointed when I act too safe  
And there is no surprise  
  
So to please you like actors do  
I changed my colors  
Traded a piece of myself  
  
Chorus   
  
They say the hardest part is to play yourself
