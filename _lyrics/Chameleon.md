Love me for me
It never works
Am I an actor
With the role of my life?

Longing for someone
Craving for more
Running from places
Where nobody cared

So I'll please you like actors do
Change my colors
So you like my reflection

Chorus:
Love me for me never works
Actors, that's what we learn
But I'll say I love you for you
Cause we both wish it was the truth
If only it could be the truth
But that's just like what actors do

I'll be your friend
Someone who listens
I won't ask the wrong question
Won't ask you to change
But if you don't like my colors
I can adapt
It's what I've been doing
For my whole life

You think that you know me
I've been trained the whole time
To be there when you ask
Getting used to the punches

Disappointed with my decisions
If I don't ask you first
Disappointed when I act too safe
And there is no surprise

So to please you like actors do
I changed my colors
Traded a piece of myself

Chorus

They say the hardest part is to play yourself
