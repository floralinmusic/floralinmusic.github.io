Hopeful heart  
Loving all the simple things  
Simple times  
I see the power of life  
When I see you now  
  
It won't last forever  
You'll stay a part of me  
Will you still remember  
The way you used to feel  
  
Prechorus  
Will you still believe me  
As time goes by  
Will you still believe me  
When you get wiser  
And I get older  
  
Chorus  
Will you feel me by your side  
When the storm comes  
Can I give you back the strength  
You gave me   
Before I even met you  
I knew I'd hold you close  
I knew I'd hold you close to me  
  
Will you trust me when you're hurt?  
Is my love enough?  
Will you forgive my mistakes?  
Dwelling on small things  
Forgetting all that really matters  
  
Will I lie to protect you  
So you don't feel the pain?  
Thinking it would be alright  
Would it only hurt you more?  
Will it only hurt you more?  
  
Chorus  
  
Prechorus   
  
Will you still feel me by your side  
When I'm gone  
When I'm gone
