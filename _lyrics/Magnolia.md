In the fading light
I can see you
Shadow of the night
We'll disappear soon

Prechorus:
It's only a goodbye
We're sheding our old skin
To be born again

Chorus:
We're magnolia
Leaving all behind
Falling petals
From another life we're
Sowing a fresh start
Ready to bloom
Before we rise
Rise again
Rise again

We remember well
All the darkness
All the fears we shared
Losing everything we had

Prechorus

Chorus

Born again
Embracing the future
at last
