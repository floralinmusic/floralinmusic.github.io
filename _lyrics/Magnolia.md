title: Magnolia  
---  
    
In the fading light  
I can see you  
Shadow of the night  
We'll disappear soon  
  
Prechorus:  
It's only a goodbye  
We're sheding our old skin  
To be born again  
  
Chorus:  
We're magnolia  
Leaving all behind  
Falling petals  
From another life we're  
Sowing a fresh start  
Ready to bloom  
Before we rise  
Rise again  
Rise again  
  
We remember well  
All the darkness   
All the fears we shared  
Losing everything we had  
  
Prechorus  
  
Chorus  
  
Born again  
Embracing the future   
at last
