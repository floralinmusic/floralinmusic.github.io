        >"The 'Lion' single, with its dual narrative structure, establishes Lin
        as an artist capable of sustained conceptual thinking without
        sacrificing emotional immediacy. It's ambitious work that rewards close
        attention and promises to reveal new layers with repeated engagement.
        Highly recommended for those seeking music that thinks as deeply as it
        feels."</i

  <p>
    Flora Lin is a singer-songwriter based in Belgium, drawing influences from
    Shoegaze to Post-Rock. Her first album "Flora" is a collaboration with
    <a href="https://recreationalnoise.bandcamp.com">Recreational Noise</a>,
    unfolding her personal stories interwoven with the symbolism of flowers —a
    metaphor for fragility, and fragrant memories. Each song is a journey of
    growth, capturing the essence of blossoming into one’s true self while
    embracing imperfections, letting go of the burdens of the past.
