(•)> Cru cru! What first got you into music?

Music Videos! As a baby, I thought they were real-time performances that repeated over and over, and that looked fun.

(•)> What's your favorite album of all time?

That's a very hard question! But the album I've listened to the longest and would still listen to in full today is 'Tidal' by Fiona Apple.

(•)> What record from the 2020's do you replay the most?

'The Redshift Blues' by Dispirited Spirits.

(•)> What should the Pigeon listen to next?

"Farewell Friend," a Cosmoose experimental pop song featuring Zephyrianna, a space pigeon V-Tuber, and my band OK Feather, which is all about pigeons.

(•)> What's the inspiration behind the music of OK Feather?

Many of us do not notice the beauty and resilience of pigeons. They are everywhere, among the less desirable aspects of the city. So we treat them as nuisances. We forget about their strength, surviving in unforgiving places. It has been OK Feather and its founder JJYY's project to celebrate pigeons through photographs, art, and music.

(•)> What memorable answers have you had to your work so far?

From time to time I get very moving reactions to my lyrics, which is amazing because they are usually not the main focus in the song production.

(•)> Who is your inspiration when creating music?

A mysterious dark pigeon with a siren voice.

(•)> Which film do you rewatch the most?

I usually don't rewatch films. But I'd like to rewatch the comedy anime series Saiki Kusuo no Psi-nan.

(•)> How is your perfect day?

A day near the sea with warm water and good food. Feeling different, like a seagull.

(•)> Will you tell us something embarassing about you?

When it comes to famous things in culture, I have no idea about most of them. I mostly pay attention to unknown projects, because I think other people can introduce me to the classics, but no one will show me cool obscure musicians like Pigeon Child or Dancing Pigeons.

(•)> Do you sing in the shower? If yes, what's the setlist?

The next OK Feather song of the year!

(•)> What's your Hot Take - your most controversial music opinion?

I'm absolutely not saying that using samples should be free or uncredited, but it should be easier to incorporate existing music or samples without involving complicated paperwork and enormous fees. Like what's done with covers.
