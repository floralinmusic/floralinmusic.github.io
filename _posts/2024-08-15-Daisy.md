Working with [Recreational Noise](https://recreationalnoise.bandcamp.com) has been all about the feels. I was finally able to let go and feel freer than ever in my songwriting.

I used to wonder how my writing and singing would be received, which resulted in a lot of self-restraint. I was concerned about coming off as too serious or overly emotional.

However, with each song, it became easier to write from the heart. One of the latest songs we've created, "Daisy," emerged from this newfound freedom. It serves as a metaphor for my liberating journey.

Like a daisy, embracing my imperfections, my negative thoughts, and my repressed anger. Like a daisy, allowing myself to feel joyful, as some of the most intense, profound, and blissful experiences have occurred in these last few years.

Soon there will be more to come...
