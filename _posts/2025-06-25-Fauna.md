[Recreational Noise](https://recreationalnoise.bandcamp.com) and I are back with a concept EP "Fauna".

Moving a bit from "Flora", we still embrace our love of post rock and shoegaze, while diving straight into alternative rock, and inserting elements of alt pop.

Our first single, "Lion, Pt. 2", received several rave reviews from these magazines:

[Sonically and lyrically, this is one of the smartest songs I have heard in a long time. - The Big Takeover](https://bigtakeover.com/recordings/flora-lin-recreational-noise-lion-pt-2-self-released)

[Lin's vocal delivery carries the particular ache of someone speaking truths they wish weren't true, while Recreational Noise's contribution provides a sonic landscape that feels both protective and suffocating. - Indie Dock](https://indiedockmusicblog.co.uk/?p=30479)

## The tale of Fauna

From the moment she was born, Fauna's world was crackled with the sounds of conflict and heated voices.
She found solace in the whispering winds and the gentle rustle of leaves, but soon enough she realized she could not easily find her place.
Yearning for affection, she often sensed that others found her strange. In her quest for acceptance, she begins to change her personality, attempting to sidestep conflict and fit in.
But how will she protect her loved ones, and who will protect her?

## Lion, Pt. 1: fighting for yourself

This is the tale of Fauna's parents—two lovers constantly fighting, being too proud to listen to each other and let down their guard. It's really about who will lose first, who will be too bruised to fight back.

"When I give you my love, you turn it as a weapon against me."

## Swan: between lost passion and betrayal

The love is almost gone, but the feelings of betrayal and hurt are still present.
Like Charles Swann from Marcel Proust's "In Search of Lost Time", there is a phase of obsession, of deep pain.
How long will it take to fade?

"There's no going back", as some decisions are permanent...

## Panda: an ode to innocence

The love story is coming to an end. In this context, Fauna is born.
Hopeful and curious about the world around her, blissfully unaware of the struggles that shaped her parents’ love. A short phase of innocence.

## Tarantula: wanting love, being unwanted

Growing up, Fauna is longing for love and acceptance. The first days of joy quickly turn to feelings of abandonment, as those who vowed to care for her ultimately give up. They say they tried their best but she's hopeless. On her best days, she feels like a ghost, and on her worst, she feels unwanted.

## Chameleon: shifting yourself to please

Fauna becomes an actor. Changing colors to please, telling people what they want to hear.
Like for actors, people have high expectations. Like for actors, people are waiting for their downfall. The castle is waiting to crumble, the façade can only fall apart.

## Lion, Pt.2: fighting for the ones you love

As she becomes an adult, Fauna vows to protect the ones she loves.
She will sacrifice her sense of self, deny her own past, so her loved ones can shine.
